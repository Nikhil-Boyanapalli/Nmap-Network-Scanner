## Security Considerations

- This tool should only be used on networks you have permission to scan
- Running network scans may trigger security systems
- Some scan types require administrator/root privileges
- Always follow your organization's security policies

## Limitations

- Scan speed depends on network size and scan type
- Some features require administrator/root privileges
- Results accuracy depends on target network conditions

## Creating Windows Executable

You can create a Windows executable file for easier distribution and use. Follow these steps:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Create the executable:

Basic version:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "Network Scanner" main.py
```

With custom icon:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico --name "Network Scanner" main.py
```

Options explained:
- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file
- `--windowed`: Prevents console window from appearing
- `--icon`: Adds a custom icon (optional)
- `--name`: Sets the executable name

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder as "Network Scanner.exe"

**Note:** 
- The executable may take longer to start compared to running the Python script
- Nmap must still be installed on the target system
- The final executable size will be larger than the Python scripts due to included dependencies
